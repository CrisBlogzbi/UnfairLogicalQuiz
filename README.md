## Styling

### Color Palette

To maintain the theme of the quiz, I've used a color palette inspired by the concept of "unfairness":

- The background is teal, reminiscent of the unfairness of life's twists and turns.
- The questions are presented in light blue, representing the uncertainty of unconventional questions.
- Correct answers are highlighted in light green, while incorrect answers turn tomato red.
